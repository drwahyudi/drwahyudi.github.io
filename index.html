<h2>Land surface dynamics MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh</h2>
I am a geologist whose now studying geomorphology in the University of Edinburgh. I am interested at earth's landscapes and their interaction with surface processes, tectonic and climate.

I am a geomorphologist that uses quantitative methods to understand why the surface of our planet looks the way it does, what that reveals about the movement of sediment, water and nutrients, and how topography can be used to infer climate and tectonics. My work investigates mountains, hillslopes and coastal environments. I combine topographic analysis, numerical modelling, fieldwork, isotopic analysis to quantify dates and rates, and theory. You can read about more by following the research links above.
