    excerpt: "**A project from my undergraduate degree**: This study aims to identify the level of tectonic activity in Padang Pariaman, West Sumatra by morphotectonic index analysis such as ; the stream-gradient index(SL), drainage basin asymmetry (Af), valley floor widthâ€“valley height ratio (Vf), drainage
density (Dd), and mountain-front sinuosity (Smf)."
