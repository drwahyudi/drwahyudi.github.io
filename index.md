<h2>Land surface dynamics MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh</h2>
I am a geologist whose now studying geomorphology in the University of Edinburgh. I am interested at earth's landscapes and their interaction with surface processes, tectonic and climate.

I use quantitative methods to understand why the surface of the earth looks the way it does, what the sediment told us about what had been occurred in the past, the present, even the future, and how topography can be used to infer climate and tectonics. Mostky, I investigates mountains, hillslopes and rivers. I combine topographic analysis, numerical modelling, fieldwork, Optical Luminescence analysis to quantify dates and rates, and theory. If you are interested by what I am working on, you can read about more by following the research links above.

If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.
