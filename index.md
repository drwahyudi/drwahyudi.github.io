<h2>Land surface dynamics MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh</h2>

I am a geologist whose now studying geomorphology at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in the earth's landscapes and their interaction with surface processes, tectonics and climate.

I use quantitative methods to understand why the surface of the earth looks the way it does, what the sediment told us about what had been occurred in the past, the present, even the future, and how topography can be used to infer climate and tectonics. Mostly, I investigate mountains, hillslopes and rivers. I combine topographic analysis, numerical modelling, fieldwork, Optical Luminescence analysis to quantify dates and rates, and theory. If you are interested in what I am working on, you can read more by following the research links above.
