<h2>Land surface dynamics MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh</h2>

I am a geologist whose now studying geomorphology in the University of Edinburgh. I am interested at earth's landscapes and their interaction with surface processes, tectonic and climate.

I use quantitative methods to understand why the surface of the earth looks the way it does, what the sediment told us about what had been occurred in the past, the present, even the future, and how topography can be used to infer climate and tectonics. Mostky, I investigates mountains, hillslopes and rivers. I combine topographic analysis, numerical modelling, fieldwork, Optical Luminescence analysis to quantify dates and rates, and theory. If you are interested by what I am working on, you can read about more by following the research links above.

<h2>Some of the activities that I do</h2>

From front-to-back there are: Me, Emma, Mark, Mikael and a Baba who rows the boat. Hugh is in front of us . 
In this picture, we were crossing the East Rapti river to collect the precious sand samples in the Churia range, a young elongated hill that built by the collision between the Indian and Asian tectonic plate! The fact that Churia range is a wild life conservative park is always thrills me for having a fieldwork in ‘Chitwan National Park’. There, we met a rhino, ridiculously beautiful birds, crocodiles and probably stalked by a tiger(s)?!
We were also became leeches (**not lychees**) lunch too!
