# Tectonic geomorphology fieldwork
Hi'ya! I have been wanting to share my fieldwork experience in Nepal for a long time. However, back then, I have not decided where should I post my story. Since I have my own guthub web page now, I am going to share my experience here. Enjoy!

## The departure
_26/09/2019_

A trip to Nepal took 18 hours flight or so with 2 hours transit in Doha. Nothing is actually exceptional on my flight from Edinburgh to Doha; it was a pleasant flight. On this trip, I went with Emma, who shares the same supervisor with me. Hugh (our supervisor), Mikael (Emma's supervisor), and Mark are waiting for us in Kathmandu. We took off from Edinburgh at 4pm and flying for 7 hours to Doha. As I said before, it was a delightful flight for me. We rode the Airbus A350 (a brand new aircraft) with spacious rooms for our legs, and the flight itself was not packed with passengers. I had an enjoyable dinner, snacks, etc. Because I do not want to miss everything that was going on with this new aircraft, which I am excited about, I did not sleep at all during my flight from Edinburgh to Doha. I was thinking that I should sleep on the next flight from Doha to Kathmandu so I would not have jet lag when I step my feet in Nepal. Soon, I am going to realise that that was a bad idea.



We landed in Doha, and Emma was excited to show me the giant teddy bear at the Doha airport. Emma had been telling me about this ginormous doll since the day before our flight at the campus. Since Emma had been visiting Nepal several times, she was familiar with all the things with Nepal's trip, including navigating through the Doha airport. She took me to the place where the giant doll belongs (located at the centre of the airport terminal). She also guided me to go to the gate for our next flight to Kathmandu (which was packed with passengers).



As I entered the aircraft, suddenly, I regretted my decision not to sleep on my previous flight. The plane was full! No empty space at all, and I sat on the middle row, which is not a very good seat to sleep. The flight started at 2 am. After we were airborne, the flight stewardess served the dinner, yep, a very late dinner. The food was great, I was happy. Feeling stuffed and tired from the previous flight, I started to close my eyelids. After two hours (or so) of sleep, the stewardess woke me up for breakfast (yes, it was breakfast! Since we were heading east, we were going into the sun!). I was not pleasant since I only took two hours of sleep from the long journey, but I had to have my breakfast anyway. It was a very quick meal; I did not even try to enjoy my food because I was really sleepyâ€¦ But then the stewardess woke me up again, this time it was for a snack! I finished my snack and got tucked up with the blanket one more time. But then the stewardess woke me up, again, and again! If it was not for refreshment drink, more snacks are coming! I should be happy with this very generous airline that keeps my tummy full all the time, but I just need some good sleep. This is when I regret my decision to stay awake all night during my flight from Edinburgh to Doha. I should have got some sleep. :(



To anyone who travels during the night flight, please, just get some sleep. Otherwise, you will end up like me.
