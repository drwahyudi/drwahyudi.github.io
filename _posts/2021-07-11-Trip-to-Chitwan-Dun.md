# Trip to Chitwan Dun
_28/09/2019_

We got ready really early in the morning and leave Kathmandu around 7 am. It was a festival day in Nepal and every body was trying to get back to their home out of Kathmandu. So as already guessed, the trafic was piling up out of Kathmandu. Yup, the perfect day to get out of Kathmandu! The trip to Chitwan Dun usually takes around four hours normally.
