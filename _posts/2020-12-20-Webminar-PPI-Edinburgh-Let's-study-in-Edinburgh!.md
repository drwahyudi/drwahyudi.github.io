# Invited talk to the Indonesian Student Association in Edinburh webinar

On December 13, I had had the honour to be invited for a talk provided by the Indonesian Student Association in Edinburh. However, the content of the talk was presented in Indonesian. To my fellow Indonesian brothers and sisters who are aiming to study abroad, especially in Edinburgh, you can find some inputs and tips about studying in Edinburgh. Pease enjoy. And, if there is any question you would like to ask me, feel free to email me by clicking the email label on the side tab.
