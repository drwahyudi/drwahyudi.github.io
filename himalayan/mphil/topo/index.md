Currently, I am working on a project that uses topographic analysis, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating on fluvial terraces, and pebbles lithology distribution.

<h2>Topographic analysis</h2>
I used the ALOS PALSAR 12.5 metre resolution DEM to obtain the spatial channel steepness (ksn), knickpoint distribution, and channel concavity (Î¸) on three thrust fold ranges in the frontal Himalaya. I compared the results of these metrics with the tectonic shortening amount across the three ranges. It demonstrates that the characteristics of those parameters developed with the increasing amount of shortening. 
Here is a talk from me about my current project:
