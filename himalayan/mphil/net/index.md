<h2> Overviews from pebbles' lithology distribution and Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating</h2>

The purpose of the OSL dating on my research project is generally to reveal the fluvial network evolution of Chitwan Dun (a piggyback basin which formed due to thrusting in the frontal Himalaya), in Nepal. The measurement of the pebble’s lithology distribution is also to reveal the fluvial network evolution in the Chitwan Dun. Constraining the fluvial network evolution in Chitwan Dun is important since most rivers are mainly deflected by the growth of faults. Hence, the development of fault propagation motion can be understood.
However, the main purpose of the OSL dating is to constrain the rate of uplift in the Churia range (one of the thrust fold ranges in which the topography I analysed). The Churia range itself is a ‘wedge-shaped’ uplifting ridge formed by the fault-propagating fold induced by the activity of the Himalayan Main Frontal Thrust (MFT). There is no uplift rate information along the Churia range, and therefore, constraining the uplift rate in this area is crucial since it is situated right next to a heavily populated area.
Aside from that, I also measured a sediment log in the outlet channel of the Chitwan Dun, which is situated near the MFT. The log measurement records a mass flow deposit followed by a ponding event and a channel succession. This information could tell us an earthquake event, which then induced a landslide and block the river. I also took two samples of OSL to constraint the timing of the event. It will give a better understanding of the fault’s behaviour in the future.

<h2> Chitwan intermontane valley fluvial network evolution </h2>
 
The Himalaya is a tectonically active orogen formed by the ongoing collision between the subducting Indian plate and the Eurasian plate (Gansser, 1964). This convergence is expressed by both vertical and lateral growth of the Himalayas, which has been accommodated by series of north dipping major thrust faults that include the Main Central Thrust (MCT), Main Boundary Thrust (MBT), and Main Frontal Thrust (MFT); these faults entrenched from a basal decollement known as the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) (Decelles et al., 2001; Dhital, 2015). The Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) mark the northern and the southern boundary of the Sub-Himalaya respectively, a structural belt consists of folded and thrusted Siwalik Hills and intermontane valleys (also referred to as piggyback basin and Dun locally), as well the deformation front of the Himalayan orogenic belt (DiPietro & Pogue, 2004). Currently, the Sub-Himalaya is believed to absorb the overall convergence that has been mainly accommodated by the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) (Dey et al., 2016a; Powers et al., 1998; Yin & Harrison, 2000).

Topographic growth due to the convergence across the Sub-Himalaya inevitably interacts with rivers flowing downstream from the Himalayan range. River channels deflected as they are blocked by the topographic growth and forced to flow parallel to the ranges, supplying sediment to the intermontane valley before exiting the plains (Burbank et al., 1996). Terraces are often preserved within the valley as the topography uplifted (Dey et al., 2016a; Divyadarshini et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2014). Series of water gaps and wind gaps may also be preserved along the ridgeline, indicating the course of the antecedent river and the sense of fault propagation (Keller et al., 1998, 1999). Alternatively, gorges are formed where rivers retain their course, preserving terraces as they incised through the uplifting topography and record the shortening and rock uplift rates over the last few thousand years as demonstrated across the Sub-Himalaya (Dey et al., 2016a; Divyadarshini et al., 2020; Gavillot et al., 2016; Lavé & Avouac, 2000; Thakur et al., 2007, 2014). Therefore, intermontane valleys are essential in understanding the interaction between tectonics and erosion as they proved to record the ongoing tectono-geomorphic processes along the frontal Himalaya (Bookhagen et al., 2006; Dey et al., 2016a, 2016b; Divyadarshini et al., 2020; Gavillot et al., 2016; Lavé & Avouac, 2000, 2001).
Currently, the Sub-Himalayan region in central Nepal has been a focus of attention as previous studies suggested that stress is accumulated within the Chitwan Dun (Fig. 1) region after the 2015 Gorkha earthquake (Avouac et al., 2015; Bilham, 2015; Bollinger et al., 2016). Unfortunately, unlike Intermontane valleys in the north-western Himalaya, such as Dehra Dun, Kangra basin, and those around the Jammu-Kashmir region, which have been well studied (Dey et al., 2016a, 2016b; Gavillot et al., 2016; Thakur et al., 2007), the intermontane valley of Chitwan Dun is relatively less studied. Observations on deformed terraces, stratigraphy, and basin-fill have been carried out to constrain tectonic development of the Chitwan Dun (Kimura, 1995, 1999; Tokuoka et al., 1988). However, chronological constraints on those study are less accurate considering the use of soil colour, surface weathering, and degree of dissection to correlate the relative age with another piggyback basin (e.g., Dang Valley in Western Nepal), which is highly dependable on various condition such as climate, parent material and soil hydrology (Iwata & Nakata, 1985; Kimura, 1994; Yamanaka & Yagi, 1984). Another work at the Bagmati Valley, east of the Chitwan Dun, uses the optically stimulated luminescence to date the terraces’ age, leading to shortening rate constrain of this region at ~20 ± 1 mm a―1 (Lavé & Avouac, 2000). More recent work at the Chitwan Dun region has used the optically stimulated dating of geomorphic units within the area to reconstruct the systematic evolution history of landforms in Chitwan Dun, which significantly improves the timing constraint of the landform evolution (Divyadarshini et al., 2020).

Providing robust age constraints for the timing of past tectonic events can offer an important contribution to understanding the active landscape evolution. Empirical datasets constraining seismic events on the past and rock uplift can be used to predict future landform response on tectonic activity. In this study, we use sedimentary and chronological data to improve the understanding of the intermontane valley’s response towards tectonic activity in Chitwan Dun by presenting field observations, terraces mapping, and optically stimulated luminescence data. We have found a tilted surface that seemed to be a channel succession deposit linked to a past seismic event at the western part of Chitwan Dun near its exit to the plains. This could help us better understand the basin’s response to a possible large-scale earthquake in the future. Information on rock uplift rate will provide an idea of how fast the landform evolves. A recent study suggested that the western tip of the Frontal Churia Range, south of Chitwan Dun, is relatively younger compared to the eastern part (Wahyudi et al., 2021). However, the rock uplift rate in this region remains unconstrained. Here, we use two luminescence samples extracted from terrace fill and uplifted surface at the western Frontal Churia Range to constrain the exact timing of uplift and rock uplift rate of the western Frontal Churia range. We also use luminescence data on terraces to improve the existing knowledge of landform development in Chitwan Dun.
