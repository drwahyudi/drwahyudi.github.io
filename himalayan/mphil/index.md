<h2>Academic</h2>
Currently, I am an MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh. My research project here encompases the use of topographic analysis to reveal the progressive evolution of mountain building process in the Himalaya. I also use the Optical Luminescence dating to date the deposition time of sediment and infer the topographic growth. On my fieldwork in Nepal Himalaya, I measured the distribution of pebbles lithology, paleoflow direction, and sedimentology log of a fluvial deposit to help me constraint the river network evolution in '*Chitwan Dun*', an intermontane basin in the frontal Himalaya.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://unpad.ac.id">*Universitas Padjadjaran*</a> in geological engineering. For my UG final project, I did something similar (but not the same) to what I do now. Hopefully, I can continue my postgraduate journey to a PhD.

<h2>Lyfe</h2>
I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung">*Bandung*</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Java">*West Java*</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Indonesia">*Indonesia*</a> which is famous for various reasons such as tourism (this city is surounded by many volcanoes and therefore the mean elevation is ~800 metre with a average temperature of 20-23°C, which is a perfect cast away from the populous and **hot** (~36°C) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), nature, food (there is a myth that the street food in Bandung is the best in Indonesia), the Mayor (now he is the Governor), education, and beatiful ladies (apparently according to other cities citizens, yup, I mean it). 

Bandung also has its very own fault, called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2018.12.014">'*Lembang fault*'</a> which is always ready to give the people of Bandung a bit of quake at anytime. The nearest volcano is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangkuban_Perahu">*Tangkuban Perahu*</a> (literally means upside down) which is right to the north of the fault. There is a mythology related to the existance of the volcano for the local people called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangkuriang">*Sangkuriang*</a>, which tells the story of the origin of the volcano, as well as the mitigation aspect if the volcano erupts. 

After I graduated my undergraduate degree, I went to Jakarta to work as hydrogeologist for a couple of years. Then I moved to Edinburgh in 2019, for my postgraduate journey. As a result, I think 20°C is 'too hot', and now I am afraid on how am I going to cope with the temperature when I come home.
