<h2>Academic</h2>
Currently, I am an MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh. My research project here encompases the use of topographic analysis to reveal the progressive evolution of mountain building process in the Himalaya. I also use the Optical Luminescence dating to date the deposition time of sediment and infer topographic growth. On my fieldwork in Nepal Himalaya, I measured the distribution of pebbles lithology, paleoflow direction, and sedimentology log of a fluvial deposit to hep me constraint the river network in '*Chitwan Dun*', an intermontane basin in the frontal Himalaya.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from Universitas Padjadjaran in geological engineering. For my UG final project, I did something similar (but not the same) to what I do now. 

<h2>Lyfe</h2>
I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung">Bandung</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Java">West Java</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Indonesia">Indonesia</a> which is famous for various reasons such as tourism (this city is surounded by many volcanoes and therefore the mean elevation is ~800 metre with a average temperature of 20-23 C which is the perfect cast away from the **HOT** (~36 C) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), food (there is a myth that the street food in Bandung is the best in Indonesia), the Mayor (now he is the Governor) and beatiful ladies (Apparently according to other cities citizens. Yup, I mean it). Bandung also has its very own fault, called 'Lembang fault' which is always ready to give the people of Bandung a bit of quake anytime.
After I graduated my undergraduate degree I went to Jakarta to work as hydrogeologist for a couple of years. Then I moved to Edinburgh in 2019, for my postgraduate journey. As a result I think 20Â°C is 'too hot', and now I am afraid how am I going to cope with the temperature when I come home. I really hope I can continue my postgraduate journey to a PhD.
