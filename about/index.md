<h2>Academic</h2>
Currently, I am an MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh. My research project here encompases the use of topographic analysis to reveal the progressive evolution of mountain building process in the Himalaya. I also use the Optical Luminescence dating to date the deposition time of sediment and infer the topographic growth. On my fieldwork in Nepal Himalaya, I measured the distribution of pebbles lithology, paleoflow direction, and sedimentology log of a fluvial deposit to help me constraint the river network evolution in '*Chitwan Dun*', an intermontane basin in the frontal Himalaya.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://unpad.ac.id">*Universitas Padjadjaran*</a> in geological engineering. For my undergraduate final project, I did something similar (*but not the same*) to what I do now. Hopefully, I can continue my postgraduate journey to a PhD.

<h2>Lyfe</h2>
I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung">*Bandung*</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Java">*West Java*</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Indonesia">*Indonesia*</a> which is famous for various reasons such as tourism (*this city is surounded by many volcanoes and therefore the mean elevation is ~800 metre with a average temperature of 20-23°C, which is a perfect cast away from the populous and **hot** (~36°C) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta">Jakarta</a>*), nature, food (*there is a roumor that the street food in Bandung is the best in Indonesia*), the Mayor (*now he is the Governor*), education, and beatiful ladies (*apparently according to other cities citizens, yup, I mean it*). 

Bandung also has its very own fault, called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2018.12.014">'*Lembang fault*'</a> which is always ready to give the people of Bandung a bit of quake at anytime. The nearest volcano is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangkuban_Perahu">*Tangkuban Perahu*</a> (*literally means upturned boat, and if you can see the volcano from Bandung city, you can tell why*) which is right to the north of the fault. There is a mythology related to the existance of the volcano for the local people called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangkuriang">*Sangkuriang*</a>, which tells the story of the origin of the volcano, as well as the mitigation aspect if the volcano erupts.

After I graduated my undergraduate degree, I went to Jakarta to work as hydrogeologist for a couple of years. Then I moved to Edinburgh in 2019, for my postgraduate journey. As a result, I think 20°C is 'too hot', and now I am afraid on how am I going to cope with the temperature when I come home.

<h2>Some of the activities that I do</h2>

*From front-to-back, there are Me, Emma, Mark, Mikael and a Baba who rows the boat. Hugh (my supervisor) sat in the front row.*
 
In this picture, we were crossing the East Rapti river to collect the precious sand samples in the Churia range, a young elongated hill built by the collision between the Indian and Asian tectonic plates! The fact that Churia range is a wildlife conservation park is always thrilled me for having fieldwork in ‘*Chitwan National Park*'. There, we met a rhino, ridiculously beautiful birds, crocodiles and probably stalked by a tiger(s)?!
We became leeches' (**not lychees**) lunch too!
